On my drive in, I was thinking about this.  This is what I came up with:

done, tested 1. Decouplers placed in Symmetry will default to symmetry for the controlling mod
done 2. There will be a tiny module called "ControllingRecoveryModule" added to every part except decouplers which will be used to store an enum identifying the controlling mod for the stage the part is in.
done 3. Decouples have a different module added, which in addition  to identifying the controlling mod, also has the UI code to allow the user to change the controlling mod.  
done 4. Right now, the UI is a button which cycles between Stage Recovery, FMRS or auto
(TODO later): 5. If a decoupler was placed in symmetry, there will be another button which will be used to remove the symmetry for this purpose only
6. The VesselModule will be used mainly to return the controlling mod for the current stage, it will look at one of the parts in the stage to get that iinfo
 

Behind the scenes, the following will be happening:

* When a decoupler has the controlling mod changed, it will recursively descend all the attached parts setting the value in the ControllingRecoveryModule.  It will stop when it hits a decoupler
* When a part is added, there will be a callback which will read the value from the parent part for the ControllingRecoveryModule and set it in the current part.
* The VesselModule will now, instead of storing the controlling mod, will return the value of the controlling mod from the lowest part (looking at the stages)
 

Comments are welcome, along with the following questions:

* It's set up right now to allow the player to change the controlling mod while in flight.  What's your feeling about that?
* I'll provide a file which will give you access to the vesselmodule, similar to what the Blizzy toolbar does, but will be a lot simpler.  I'm doing it this way in case it needs to change in the future, it will avoid the need to have you change anything in your code.  While I haven't done anything with this yet, I'm hoping to be able to have it do the following:
* Return controlling mod for current stage
* Return controlling mod for specified part
* Set controlling mod for specified stage (all decouplers)
* Set controlling mod for specified decoupler

Once this is done, I'm going to be updating PartWizard, to have a nice UI to be able to set all the decouplers on a vessel in a more intuitive method.  PartWizard will also be using this file
